/**
 * Enhance Truecolor Contrast
 * 
 * This plugin enables to increase the contrast of truecolor images
 * in the HSB color space to avoid any changes in hue and saturation
 * The method uses a high precision calculation approach to avoid
 * a conversion between RGB and HSB (since the latter suffers from
 * loss of precision and image quality!).
 * 
 * The saturation field can be used equivalent to the one in the 
 * normal enhance contrast function in ImageJ
